# ðŸ§  Adult Income Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

A machine learning project to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K using the UCI Adult Census dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This notebook focuses on a binary classification task to predict income level based on demographic and employment-related features. It includes full preprocessing, data exploration, and model training.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical features)
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Built and compared multiple machine learning models using Scikit-learn

## ðŸ¤– Models Trained

- Logistic Regression  
- Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

- Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualized results using confusion matrix and classification reports

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Add model saving and deployment using Streamlit  
- Try hyperparameter tuning and advanced feature selection
